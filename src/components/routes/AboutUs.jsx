                <h3>“My name is Harry Nelson and I am a Trust Breaking SEO. 
                    We've all had disappointments, from eating in a disgusting restaurant or buying property in a 'bad neighbourhood'. I as any other person encounter this on a regular basis and by reading reviews of anything or checking the reputation of a brand, the company has realised that it is all bought-and-pasted good reviews, I am outraged at how easily large resources go under the influence of money and have decided to put a stop to it! I have decided I will create my own, honest, non-compromising review site where I can honestly look my readers in the eye and give feedback at whatever the cost. ”</h3>
