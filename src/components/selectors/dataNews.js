After that you can prepare a letter or an email describing how you got deceived from them.

If you are not familiar with the case, the aforementioned New York regulators wanted to create a licensing system for crypto exchanges. The idea was to make the Big Apple a major cryptocurrency trading centre, just how it is in traditional finance. That being the case the project wasn’t appreciated by most of the companies in the field, as a lot of them didn’t apply for it. Those who argue this makes it basically useless are backed by the rate at which licensing was given to the companies who did apply. At the time of writing of this review, two years since the legislation came into effect, only three companies have been granted the license.',

However, it does not take more than a scratch on the surface to see the ugly truth, which happens to be that 44Trades is just another offshore broker that has been blacklisted by the Spanish financial authorities.
        On top of this 44Trades makes a fuss about how the number 44 is related to financial success in some numerological mystical ways.
        It is clear that if your broker is also offering astrology advice their legitimacy really should be questioned. All in all, the broker is a scam based in the Marshall Islands and does everything that can be done to avoid providing their clients with adequate and safe trading conditions.`,
