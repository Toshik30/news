After that you can prepare a letter or an email describing how you got deceived from them.

That being the case the project wasn’t appreciated by most of the companies in the field, as a lot of them didn’t apply for it. Those who argue this makes it basically useless are backed by the rate at which licensing was given to the companies who did apply.

        Another alarming issue is that CFDtrades does not disclose where they are based, this means that the client has no idea where their money is actually going when they invest with CFDtrades.`,
