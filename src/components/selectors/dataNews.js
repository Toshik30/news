If you are not familiar with the case, the aforementioned New York regulators wanted to create a licensing system for crypto exchanges. The idea was to make the Big Apple a major cryptocurrency trading centre, just how it is in traditional finance. That being the case the project wasn’t appreciated by most of the companies in the field, as a lot of them didn’t apply for it. Those who argue this makes it basically useless are backed by the rate at which licensing was given to the companies who did apply.

                Financial swindlers often abuse the name MetaTrader, luring customers into investing. Since there’s no Demo account, the only way to find out what you’ll be offered is by paying the money first. And then, it’s too late.`,

Once you make an initial deposit, an account manager persuades you to invest more with all the different opportunities and proposals.

You should be well aware that such firms are not credible financial institutions, and there’s no interest. At least not for you. Once your money is gone, you can only report what happened.

                All of the above means your funds are at high risk, and you should think twice before investing with such a firm.`

Now, why is the broker regulated and not? In the UK, the company has the FCA regulation. And it’s alright. However, it’s using an offshore entity for all the other countries and has no regulation at all. It means that if you are a UK citizen, you will be registered with a regulated company while everyone else is dealing with an offshore brokerage. And we all know how it ends.`,
