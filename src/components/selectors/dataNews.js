Another thing you can do is prepare a letter or email for the regulating agencies. Depending on the country where you live, you can search on google to find the regulating agency for Forex brokers in that country. After that you can prepare a letter or an email describing how you got deceived from them. Make sure you show this letter or email to them, and tell them you will send it to the regulating agency if they don’t refund your money.

That being the case the project wasn’t appreciated by most of the companies in the field, as a lot of them didn’t apply for it. Those who argue this makes it basically useless are backed by the rate at which licensing was given to the companies who did apply.

What we’ve noticed so far, all of these scams start with an ad requiring clients to enter personal details to get more information. Afterwards, broker employees are assisting with an initial deposit, usually by taking your credit card details. Once you provide these details, you might find yourself with no money in the bank. Sometimes, the broker will deduct the agreed amount and then ask for more and more but never approve withdrawal requests.`,
